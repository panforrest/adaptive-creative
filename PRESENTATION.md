## Q&A Preparation (2 minutes)

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "How do you handle edge cases?"**
A: "We use a hybrid approach - 85% AI automation with 15% human review workflow. Cultural adaptation engine flags high-risk modifications for human approval. Think of it as AI-assisted, not fully automated."

**Q: "What's the accuracy compared to human localization?"**
A: "In our testing, AI matches human quality on 85% of modifications. The remaining 15% gets human QA. But here's the key - we're 100x faster, so brands can afford to test more variants and iterate."

**Q: "How does this scale to 1000s of videos?"**
A: "Built on AWS infrastructure with parallel processing. TwelveLabs handles enterprise volume, ElevenLabs supports batch processing. We've architected for 10,000 videos/month capacity."

**Q: "What about video editing - how do you actually modify the video?"**
A: "We use FFmpeg for video processing - scene extraction, overlay application, audio replacement. For the hackathon we focused on the AI intelligence layer, but production version includes full video rendering pipeline."

**Q: "Business model - why would brands pay for this?"**
A: "Current cost: $40K per market √ó 50 markets = $2M. Our cost: $10K total. Even at $50K/campaign, we save them $1.95M. The ROI is undeniable. Plus, they can launch 80x faster - speed to market is worth millions."

**Q: "What about Swayable integration?"**
A: "We use Swayable's historical persuasion data to predict which cultural adaptations will drive highest brand lift. Each variant gets a predicted persuasion score based on similar campaigns in that market."
